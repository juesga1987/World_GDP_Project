# World_GDP_Project
An individual project using Python Pandas and PowerBI to analyze the GDP behavior since 1961 per country and continent.

To develop the analysis we took a table from kaggle.com that has the GDP per country since 1.961 to 2.021. All the ETL was made with Pandas library and then the dataframe was exported to .CSV file we use to generate the dashboard in PowerBI.
